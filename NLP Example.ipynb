       "\"Emma Woodhouse  handsome  clever  and rich  with a comforrrtable home and happy dispoisition  seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existencce  and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to disrtress or vex her.  She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affecetionate  indulgent father  and had  in consequence of her sister's marriiiage  been mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses  and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess  who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.  Sixxteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family  less as a governess than a friend  very fond of both daughters  but paarrticularly of Emma.  Between  them  it was more the intimacy of sisters.  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governancness  the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint  and the shadow of authority being now long passed away  they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached  and Emma doing just what she liked  highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgement  but directed chiefly by her own.  The real evils  indeed  of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way  and a dispposition to think a little too well of herself  these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger  however  was at present so unpreceived  that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.  Sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any disagreable consciousness.  Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuancee.\""
